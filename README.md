# On Missing Data Sets

## Overview

### What is a Missing Data Set?

"Missing data sets" are my term for the blank spots that exist in spaces that are otherwise data-saturated. My interest in them stems from the observation that within many spaces where large amounts of data are collected, there are often empty spaces where no data live. Unsurprisingly, this lack of data typically correlates with issues affecting those who are most vulnerable in that context. 

The word "missing" is inherently normative, it implies both a lack and an ought: something does not exist, but it should. That which should be somewhere is not in its expected place; an established system is disrupted by distinct absence. Just because some type of data doesn't exist doesn't mean it's missing, and the idea of missing data sets is inextricably tied to a more expansive climate of inevitable and routine data collection.


### Why Do They Matter?

The things we ignore reveal more than those we give our attention to. It’s in those things that we find hints of cultural and colloquial ideas of that which is deemed important. We only pay attention to the things that matter to us, so the things that we've left blank reveal our hidden social biases and indifferences.

### Why Are They Missing? 
There are a number of reasons why a data set that seems like it *should* exist might not. Below are just three, all results of the quietly complicated nature of data collection:

1. Those who have the resources to collect the data lack an incentive to.
2. The data to be collected resists simple quantification (corollary: we prioritize collecting things that fit our limited modes of collection).
3. The act of collection involves a more work than the benefit that the presence of the data is perceived to give. 


###  Any Examples? 
Here's a well-known example: though policing and crime are among the most data-driven areas of public policy, there’s no history of data on police brutality. To this day, the only means through which data on civilians killed by legal enforcement agencies exists is through the public interest work of campaigns like [Fatal Encounters](http://www.fatalencounters.org/) and the Guardian’s [The Counted](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database). 

Below I've got an ever-expanding list of missing datasets. Contributions are extra welcome.

## An Incomplete List of Missing Data Sets 
- Civilians killed in encounters with police or law enforcement agencies
- Sales and prices in the art world (and relationships between artists and gallerists)
- People excluded from public housing because of criminal records
- Trans people killed or injured in instances of hate crime
- Poverty and employment statistics that include people who are behind bars
- Muslim mosques/communities surveilled by the FBI/CIA
- Mobility for older adults with physical disabilities or cognitive impairments
- LGBT older adults discriminated against in housing 
- Undocumented immigrants currently incarcerated and/or underpaid  
- Undocumented immigrants for whom prosecutorial discretion has been used to justify release or general punishment 
- Measurements for global web users that take into account shared devices and VPNs
- True measures around how often sexual harassment happens in the workplace
- Firm statistics on how often police arrest women for making false rape reports 
- Caucasian children adopted by parents of color
- Total number of local and state police departments using stingrays

## Responses
My hypothesis is that one answer to these missing datasets lies in those who have a stake in the data cooperating to disrupt the structures preventing access to it, a la Jonah Bossewitch and Aram Sinnreich's sousveillance society model (see Resources folder for paper). 

But a tricky aspect of dealing with missing data sets is that they hint at larger problems, and the answer to those problems **does not universally lie in collecting more data**. Sometimes the lack of these data can be just as empowering as their presence. 

As part of my [Data & Society](datasociety.net) fellowship, I'm working on a number of projects that aim to consider possible responses to missing data sets. This will be updated with documentation of those projects as they are published.

## Resources 
See Resources folder (note: folder to be continually updated). 

The Detroit Geographic Society could count as an old-school example of a response to something like this; see Catherine D'Ignazio's excellent [case study]("https://civic.mit.edu/blog/kanarinka/the-detroit-geographic-expedition-and-institute-a-case-study-in-civic-mapping") on it. 

My [initial blogpost](http://mimionuoha.com/thoughts/2015/11/15/missing-datasets) about the topic.
